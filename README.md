InstaTakePHP
============

A PHP implementation for backing up your (or others') instagram account.

You only have to set the "$folder_path" variable to the folder where you want to download your pics and then access the page.

This project is inspired by https://github.com/duplikey/instatake, which was taken down by Instagram (bummer!).
